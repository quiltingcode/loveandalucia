            <h2>Welcome to Andalucia!</h2>
            <p>
                Spanning more than 800km of beautiful coastline across eight diverse provinces, this Mediterranean region of Southern Spain is now one of the most popular European holiday destinations.  Between these 8 provinces there really is something for everyone, whether you are looking for a city break, a country escape, or some sea and sun along the coast.

                Historically, Andalucia has always been well known for its extensive agriculture and home grown produce, even earning the nickname and a recent TV series called ‘El Mar de Plastico’ for the quantity of greenhouses covering the coastal province of Almeria. Roman and Arabic influences can be found throughout the region and among its impressive architecture but what Andalucia is more recently famous for is it’s unique style of dancing, known as Flamenco.

                The easiest way to get to Andalucia is by air, flying into the heart of the region’s Malaga International Airport (AGP). From there, you can catch a bus or a train out to the surrounding provinces or hire a car and go wherever the wind takes you!
